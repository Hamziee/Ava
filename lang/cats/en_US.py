description = "Currently the bot uses TheCatAPI which is not free to use, that's why Hamzie API (the source of most images Ava uses) is making their own cat's section, free to use for everyone. We ask you to send in your best cat pictures, for it to be used in Hamzie API, which will eventually replace TheCatAPI in this command."
